# Machine-Learning-Trading-Bot
In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

First attempt training values:

DateOffset(months=3)

second attempt training values:

DateOffset(months=1)

First attempt windows:

short_window = 4
long_window = 100

Third attempt windows
short_window = 10
long_window = 80

optimized windows:

short_window = 4
long_window = 100
